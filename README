This IS NOT my VPN. I found it online and decided to post it here.
A few things before we start,
one, this VPN has a weird bug where it keeps giving you notifications.
Two, this VPN is used if you have really slow downloads. (you have good internet but and app you try to install takes days)

How to install: 
Turn on dev mode. (https://support.arborxr.com/article/110-enable-developer-mode-on-oculus-quest-quest-2-devices)
Download the APK file.
Download SideQuest. (https://sidequestvr.comg)
Connect your oculus to sidequest. (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cU9ylRds8ho)
Drag the APK file to the top left of SideQuest. (green circle)
Wait for it to install.
Go onto your oculus and under the "Unknow Sources" sections of the apps run the VPN.

My discord is Elijah33#7414 if you have any questions!
